# CIS6930-Hashtable-Implementation
Implementation of multi-hashing table, Cuckoo hash table and D Left hash table in Java.

## Steps To Run:  
1. Import the project into an IDE such as Eclipse or IntelliJ and run the ApplicationRunner.java file.  
2. Enter 1 for Multi Hashing Table Implementation, 2 for Cuckoo Hash Table implementation and 3 for D Left Hash Table Implementation.  
3. The output would print the number of flow entries in the hash table and the flow ids of the flows which were inserted into the hash table.  

## Output:  
1. Multi Hashing Table.
